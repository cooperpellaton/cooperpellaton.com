#You made what? A website?!

##What is this thing?
This site is a personal effort by Cooper Pellaton to put work on the web :cat:. The intent of this site is not to look pretty, or to be on the leading edge of design, but simply to look as ugly as possible. It's my express opinion that content transcends form and I do not want to parade a fancy site when the most important thing is the work and writing I am hosting there.

It is my intent that for every major milestone update this site gets, the CSS will regress :boom:. Weren't expecting that one were you? The ultimate goal is to ship a site with almost zero CSS so as to convey that at `cepp.at` the most important thing is truly the content :bomb:. I am not trying to sound elitist or champion my ideals to others, but I simply what to explain that I have no intent of ever making this look better, only worse because I think that is the true mark of brilliant content.
