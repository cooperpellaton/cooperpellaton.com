I find that one of the most mentally challenging tasks is figuring out when I have finished with something — not a task, but an object. For some it can be easy: the bar of soap diminishes to none, or the sponge falls apart, but with others it is not so clear.

This is a constant source of frustration for me. In the abstract, it is the struggle of not wanting to waste a resource (the object and the initial expenditure) which then translates to a genuine loss of happiness — the inverse of what the object was designed to bring. In the tangible, it is the Palomino [Blackwing](http://blackwingpencils.com) that is just smaller than my palm, but still long enough to write, or the last pages of a notebook that aren’t enjoyable to write on, but are between me and finishing.

This is a daily struggle. Where is the line between joy and practicality, and how do I handle this delineation? 

My solution is suboptimal, but emphasizes what I find personally important: joy over practicality. That means I dispose of the pencil when it is too short and hurts my hand to write, and that I start a new notebook when it is no longer *enjoyable* to write in the current one. It means that I sacrifice some portion of an item’s utility: I’m *finishing* before the end of the its lifespan.

This is what I am trying to internalize: not the idea that I need to prioritize joy, but that sometimes doing so means compromising on other ideals.
