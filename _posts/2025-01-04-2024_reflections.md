This year was monumental. I fell just short of [settling all family business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pf8BkFLBRw), instead making do with just:

- Getting engaged.
- Buying a home.
- Getting married.
- Finding a new job.
- Developing my first grey hair.

It became apparent this year that personal fulfillment and growth are critical to long term well being. To move in this direction I started:

- Running, seriously.
- Asking _why_ so as to develop a deeper understanding of myself and my motivations.

In 2025 Iâ€™m looking forward to:

- Running my first marathon.
- Making my house feel like a home.
- Working to find personal happiness.
