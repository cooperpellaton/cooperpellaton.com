				<p>At a cursory glance, I am a Computer Science major (currently considering a double major in Applied Mathematics) and a general nerd. I have been computing for the majority of my life. I started at age 4 by sitting on my father's lap while he was working
					for a telecom company to lay fiber in mid-African countries.</p>

				<p>In depth, I am a convoluted mess. I rowed for Saugatuck Rowing Club from Fall 2011 until Fall 2014, and before that at Maritime Rowing Club from Fall 2009 to Fall 2011. I have been a varisty coxswain earning national bids, and a nationally acclaimed
					sailor who's had the blessing to sail with prior Olympains and win a North American Championship at Lunenburg Yacht Club in the Sonar Class in August 2014.</p>

				<p>As academic matters go I am the former president of Wilton High School located in Wilton, Connecticut. I was also a member and am a continuing supporter of St.Baldrick's, Best Buddies and now the Astronomy Club at University of Massachusets Amherst
					where I am currently a student.</p>

				<p>My computing interests, and those for the pursuit of Computer Science lie in the theoretical field. Compilers have fascinated me for a long time and I am now pursuing study in theoretical CS at UMass Amherst.</p>

				<p>This site is my outlet. It's the place that I intend to chronicle many of my journey's through the computing space that I occupy. Right now I am planning on a move to 100% free software by May 5, 2016 which will require me to leave the comfy Mac OS-X
					space that I occupy and move to the luxurious space that is Arch linux. Beyond that I am going to post some of my thoughts on free software and open source software (OSS) here. As a contributing member to JMAP I like what OSS stands for, but dislike
					many of the trends that are becoming imbued in the space.</p>

				<p>Lastly, I often get confused. This is version 1 and I guarantee there will be many bugs and incorrect statements on this site-- it's just who I am. I often think to myself "I should just quit computing while I am still ahead because this is getting
					too confuisng" but this site is a place for me to talk about that which confuses me and then explain how I managed to traverse it. Think of me as the lowest common demoninator. If I can do something, you most certainly can. So, I plan on providing
					some guides to do basic tasks (setup TarSnap, etc) and what not for people to snack on.</p>

				<p>Until next time, to safer computing we move.</p>
