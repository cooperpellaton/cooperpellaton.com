        <p>I am Swiss ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and I like computers and mathematics.</p>
        <p>Before falling head first into computing, I was a rower. Affiliated with Saugatuck Rowing Club from Fall 2011 - Fall 2014, and before that Maritime Rowing Club from Fall 2009 - Fall 2011, I was a varisty coxswain that earned national bids. I am also a nationally acclaimed sailor who's had the blessing to train with prior Olympains and win a North American Championship at Lunenburg Yacht Club in the Sonar Class in August 2014.</p>
        <p>My computing interests lie in the theoretical field. Compilers have fascinated me for a long time and so now, by extension, I study theoretical Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>To safer computing we move.</p>
