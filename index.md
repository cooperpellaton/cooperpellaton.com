I am Swiss ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and I like computers.

Currently, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/). I studied at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). Previously, I built the AI Platform team at [Humane](https://hu.ma.ne), and kept the lights on at [Memora Health](https://www.memorahealth.com/) alongside some research at the [Wheeler Laboratory](http://wheelerlab.gatech.edu); I've also been at [Cigna SE&I](http://www.cigna.com/Cigna) (S16),
[Alibaba DAIL](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/data-analytics-and-intelligence) (S18) and [Video<sup>++</sup>](http://videojj.com/).

I'm quite interested in making systems go fast using distributed compute & machine learning. I enjoy

I'm a nationally acclaimed rower and sailor.
