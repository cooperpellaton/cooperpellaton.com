            A couple of weeks ago I talked to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/mengfei.shen" target="_blank" class="emphasis">Meng Fei</a> about Valentine's day. She told me I couldn't get you flowers, chocolate, or jewelry. She said that all of those things were too typical for someone as special as you. I decided to listen to her, save about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/track?track=yes&trackNums=1Z066V300311263561" target="_blank" class="emphasis">chocolate</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've opted to buy you this site and write you a love letter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I asked you out on Monday, November 17<sup>th</sup> and we went on our first date on Saturday November 22<sup>nd</sup>. Since then, one thing remains constant: you're the last thing I think about before I go to bed and the first on my mind when I wake. You're the first person I talk to when I'm happy and the first I turn to when I'm frustrated. You're <i>the</i> person. You're <i><b>my</b></i> person.
        </p>
        <p>
            My love for you is everlasting. Nothing can change that. You're one of the only things in this world that can always make me happy (save <a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/Pt8K8BK.gifv" target="_blank" class="emphasis">cats</a>) and I'm constantly amazed that you choose to waste so much time dating me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember when we first started dating and friends/family would ask about you. After describing not only your beauty, but your intellect the universal remark was always “she's dating you?!” If there's one piece of advice that I've taken to heart it's that I shouldn't ever let you go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, for me, is that feeling of warmth I get when you hold me oh-so tightly and you rock me back and forth. It's that feeling of fullness within me when you look me in the eyes and intently stare. It's the feeling of comfort I have with you in deep silence. Love for me is all that <i>you</i> give, it's something that you, and <i>you alone</i> can give to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            You've done more for me over the past year and three months than you know. Most importantly, you've given me something about which I can constantly be happy and thankful. No matter how bad my day, I know that I have you. That doesn't make it okay, but it makes it worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
            In words I can never convey what I feel in emotion, and that coupled with the fact that you're finding grammatical errors means it's time for me to stop writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's nothing particularly special for me about Valentine's day; I love you the same as any other day. I decided to do this so that the rest of the world could know how it is that I feel about you.
        </p>
        <p>
            我爱你 我的小熊猫！
        </p>
        <p>
            爱你的饼干
