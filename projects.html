    <h1>Not-So-Cool Projects</h1>
    <p>I'm a pretty boring guy, let's be honest. Here you can find the boring projects that I waste most of my time on. This should be pretty self-explanatory, but to avoid any questions I'll make this clear. I host <b>all</b> my code on Github. I'm a believer in FOSS and therefore none of my work or information is private. On this site I've created an additional space where I can put up additional resources and/or information/comments that didn't make it into the git repositories. Also, this comprises and entire list of what I've worked on.</p>
